# Paint

Basic paint application built as a coding challenge and to learn about drawing with the Canvas element.

Bootstrapped with Create React App (with TypeScript)

## Requirements

- Built and tested with Node `v14.15.1` (run `nvm use` in the project directory if you have NVM installed)

## Setup

- Clone repo
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run local server: `yarn start`
- Open http://localhost:3000 (if you have something already running on port `3000`, it should automatically rollover to the next available port, likely `:3001`)
